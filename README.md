# PCR-99: A Practical Method for Point Cloud Registration with 99 Percent Outliers

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16598)

MATLAB implementation of our work **"PCR-99: A Practical Method for Point Cloud Registration with 99 Percent Outliers"**. 

There are four different versions:
1. **PCR99a**: Unknown scale, With sample ordering
2. **PCR99b**: Unknown scale, With random sampling
3. **PCR99c**: Known scale, With sample ordering
4. **PCR99d**: Known scale, With random sampling (NOT RECOMMENDED!)


### Quick Start:

Run `main.m`.
